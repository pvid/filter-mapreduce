# HBase (filter)MapReduce

A toy MapReduce-ish framework built on top of HBase filters and coprocessors.
It is meant to illustrate the possibilities for extension of HBase

For more information, see the accompanying blog post: [HBase (filter)MapReduce](https://vidlicka.dev/blog/hbase-filter-mapreduce)

## Compile and run tests

The project uses [Maven wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper).

To compile and run tests run

```bash
./shakespeare-transform-command.sh # prepares a dataset used in tests
./mvnw test
```

The build is a bit temperamental (probably because of files generated by `protoc`).
If you run into problems, try to do a clean build (`./mvnw clean`).

You should not need to build a JAR since this project is not meant to be deployed
or used a dependency.

It uses HBase 2.2.3. If you look through commit history, versions for HBase 1.5.0 and 1.2.0 can also be found.

## Shakespeare dataset

One of the test suites / examples uses a dataset comprised of the complete works of Shakespeare.
I got it from [a Kibana tutorial](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.5/tutorial-load-dataset.html).

The raw dataset needs to be transformed using `awk` and `jq`. See the script `shakespeare-transform-command.for details`

## Documentation

Build API documentation using

```bash
./mvnw javadoc:javadoc
```

The resulting artifacts can be found in `./target/site/apidocs`.
